# Runebuild
###### *A very poorly built build system written in [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin) for [BGFX](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx), hold together by duct tape and superglue that I made for myself, and decided to upload it.*

## Building

```
git clone https://github.com/zsigsza/runebuild.git
cd runebuild
odin build .
```

Then add the folder to your environment variables,
or put it in `/usr/local/bin` if you're a kool kid.

## Usage
`runebuild help` for a list of commands and how to use them.

*For more information about the config, check out `default.ini`.*
